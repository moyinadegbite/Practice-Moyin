 <p>You might be confused...lol but you know, i've got to aspire. And the assignment says "about yourself" right? I'm just trying to make this fun and also give a detailed information about myself but still you can't know all about a person from a write up. (is that even true?). Anyways...we moveeeee</p>

<h2>My Hobbies</h2>
<p>To be honest, I don't really have much hobbies. I sing almost anytime. Singing is therapeutic for me. it eases me of stress, makes me happy...i don't even know how to explain the feeling.</p>
<p>Another thing i do for fun is cooking, OMG! I might not be much of a cook but then i enjoy doing it. I just want to be there...experimenting with whatever i find and always wanting to do some cooking procedures another way to see how it'd turn out and trust me when i say it always turn out really good. I've received compliments from family and friends about my cooking and it always feel good to be praised.</p>
